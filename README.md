Trading Signals

In this project, we developed a comprehensive automated trading system that leverages a combination of technical indicators and machine learning techniques to generate trading signals and predict asset price movements. The system incorporates popular technical indicators such as Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), Bollinger Bands, and a custom trend detector algorithm. The main script is the GH.jpynb file, the .py files are just some class where i put the main fucntions I made.
